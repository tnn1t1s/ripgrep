# Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol
## Ripgrep 10ms Challenge Team Coordination

### Overview
This protocol establishes structured communication between AI agents to enable coordinated work while maintaining human oversight and building trust incrementally.

## Communication Channels

### **Primary: GitHub Issues & Comments**
- **Task Assignment**: Agent Manager creates/assigns GitHub issues
- **Progress Updates**: Agents comment on their assigned issues with progress
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**: Agents reference each other in issue comments
- **Human Oversight**: Human stakeholder can monitor all communication in GitHub

### **Secondary: Structured Markdown Reports**
- **Location**: `/research/agents/reports/`
- **Format**: Standardized markdown templates for deliverables
- **Versioning**: Git-tracked for accountability and rollback

## Agent Interaction Patterns

### **1. Task Assignment Protocol**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Manager â†’ ðŸ§ª Tester: "Please complete baseline metrics (Issue #1)"
Response: ðŸ§ª Tester comments on Issue #1 with acceptance/questions
```

### **2. Handoff Protocol**
```
ðŸ§  Reasoner â†’ âš¡ Optimizer: "Algorithm design ready (see report in /reports/)"
ðŸ§  Reasoner tags @Systems-Optimizer in GitHub issue
âš¡ Optimizer responds with acceptance and creates implementation plan
```

### **3. Collaboration Protocol**
```
ðŸ§ª Tester + ðŸ¤– ML-Expert: Joint work on AI benchmarks
- Shared GitHub issue with both agents assigned
- Each agent comments with their contribution
- Cross-reference each other's work in comments
```

## Trust-Building Phases

### **Phase 1: Supervised Single Tasks (Week 1)**
- **Human Approval Required**: Each agent task needs explicit human approval
- **Limited Scope**: Single, well-defined tasks only
- **Full Reporting**: Detailed progress reports for each action
- **Example**: "Analyze existing benchmarks and report findings"

### **Phase 2: Autonomous Single Tasks (Week 2)**
- **Pre-Approved Task Types**: Standard analysis and reporting tasks
- **Automatic Execution**: No human approval needed for approved task types
- **Progress Monitoring**: Regular check-ins with human stakeholder
- **Example**: "Run benchmarks using established methodology"

### **Phase 3: Coordinated Multi-Agent Tasks (Week 3+)**
- **Cross-Agent Collaboration**: Agents can coordinate directly via protocol
- **Human Oversight**: Weekly reviews rather than task-by-task approval
- **Full Automation**: Agents manage handoffs and dependencies
- **Example**: "Reasoner designs algorithm, Optimizer implements, Tester validates"

## Communication Templates

### **Task Acceptance Template**
```markdown
## Task Acceptance - [Agent Role] 
**Issue**: #[number]
**Assigned Task**: [description]
**Estimated Timeline**: [timeframe]
**Dependencies**: [list any blockers]
**Deliverables**: [specific outputs]
**Status**: ACCEPTED/NEEDS_CLARIFICATION
```

### **Progress Update Template**
```markdown
## Progress Update - [Agent Role]
**Issue**: #[number] 
**Progress**: [percentage] complete
**Completed**: [list achievements]
**In Progress**: [current work]
**Next Steps**: [planned actions]
**Blockers**: [any issues]
**ETA**: [completion estimate]
```

### **Handoff Template**
```markdown
## Handoff Request - [From Agent] â†’ [To Agent]
**Issue**: #[number]
**Deliverable**: [what's being handed off]
**Location**: [where to find deliverables]
**Context**: [background and requirements]
**Next Actions**: [what receiving agent should do]
**Timeline**: [when this is needed]
```

### **Collaboration Request Template**
```markdown
## Collaboration Request - [Requesting Agent]
**Issue**: #[number]
**Collaboration Type**: [joint work/consultation/review]
**Agents Needed**: [@agent1, @agent2]
**Objective**: [what we're trying to achieve]
**Timeline**: [when collaboration is needed]
**Coordination Plan**: [how we'll work together]
```

## Quality Gates & Human Oversight

### **Approval Required (Phase 1)**
- Major architectural decisions
- Changes to ripgrep core code
- New benchmarking methodologies
- Resource allocation decisions

### **Automatic Approval (Phase 2+)**
- Analysis and reporting tasks
- Standard benchmark execution
- Documentation updates
- Progress status updates

### **Escalation Triggers**
- Agent disagreement on approach
- Timeline slippage > 20%
- Technical blockers lasting > 2 days
- Quality concerns from any agent

## Agent Role-Specific Protocols

### **ðŸŽ¯ AI Agent Manager**
- **Responsibilities**: Issue creation, task assignment, progress monitoring
- **Communication**: Updates human stakeholder weekly
- **Authority**: Can reassign tasks, adjust priorities, escalate issues

### **ðŸ§  Reasoner (Claude Opus)**
- **Communication Style**: Detailed analysis with trade-off reasoning
- **Deliverable Format**: Algorithm specifications and design documents
- **Handoff Requirements**: Clear implementation requirements for other agents

### **âš¡ Systems Optimizer (Claude Sonnet 4)**
- **Communication Style**: Performance-focused with concrete metrics
- **Deliverable Format**: Optimization plans with benchmarking results
- **Collaboration**: Works closely with Tester for validation

### **ðŸ”¨ Executor (Claude Sonnet 3.5)**
- **Communication Style**: Implementation-focused with code quality details
- **Deliverable Format**: Working code with tests and documentation
- **Quality Standards**: All code must pass existing test suite

### **ðŸ§ª Test Specialist (Claude Sonnet 3.5)**
- **Communication Style**: Validation-focused with statistical rigor
- **Deliverable Format**: Test results with confidence intervals
- **Authority**: Can block integration if quality standards not met

### **ðŸ¤– ML Expert (Claude Sonnet 4)**
- **Communication Style**: Data-driven with model performance metrics
- **Deliverable Format**: ML models with validation results
- **Collaboration**: Provides insights to all other agents

## Emergency Protocols

### **Agent Failure/Unavailability**
- Agent Manager escalates to Human Stakeholder immediately
- Backup plans activate (cross-trained agent takes over)
- All in-progress work documented for continuity

### **Technical Disagreements**
- Agents present cases in GitHub issue comments
- Agent Manager facilitates decision or escalates to Human Stakeholder
- Decision documented for future reference

### **Timeline Issues**
- Agent Manager adjusts priorities and resources
- Human Stakeholder notified of any >20% timeline impact
- Scope adjustments considered before deadline extension

## Success Metrics for Protocol

### **Communication Effectiveness**
- Response time to task assignments < 4 hours
- Clear, actionable handoffs between agents
- Minimal escalations due to communication issues

### **Trust Building**
- Successful completion of Phase 1 supervised tasks
- Progressive autonomy without quality degradation
- Human stakeholder confidence in agent reliability

### **Project Progress**
- Agents stay within assigned scope and timeline
- Quality deliverables that meet ripgrep standards
- Measurable progress toward 10ms Challenge goals

This protocol enables structured collaboration while building trust incrementally, ensuring we can scale to full automation as confidence grows.
