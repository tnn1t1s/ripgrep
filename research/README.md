# The 10ms Challenge: Scaling Ripgrep Optimizations for Billion-Query Impact

## Research Thesis

Ripgrep is likely called over a billion times per week across global developer workflows, especially in coding assistants and automated tooling. Improving ripgrep's performance by just 10ms per query could result in massive collective productivity gains - potentially saving millions of hours of developer time annually.

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Understanding
1. **Learn the repo structure** - Deep dive into ripgrep's architecture and design patterns
2. **Learn the history of rg** - Understand evolution of performance optimizations and design decisions
3. **Evaluate current benchmarks** - Analyze existing performance testing and bottleneck identification

### Phase 2: Research & Analysis  
4. **Deep research into performance improvement opportunities** - Profile, analyze, and identify optimization targets
5. **Extend evaluation suite for modern coding assistant usage** - Build benchmarks reflecting real-world AI agent patterns
6. **Design usage data collection strategies** - Methods to quantify ripgrep's actual global usage patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation & Impact
7. **Prototype and test optimization ideas** - Implement targeted performance improvements
8. **Improve ripgrep** - Contribute meaningful performance enhancements back to the project
