# The 10ms Challenge: Scaling Ripgrep Optimizations for Billion-Query Impact

## Research Thesis

Ripgrep is called an estimated 1.4-3.5 billion times per week across global developer workflows, especially in coding assistants and automated tooling. Based on our baseline performance analysis, improving ripgrep's performance by 10ms per query would save approximately 78,000-140,000 hours annually across the global developer ecosystem - equivalent to 39-70 full-time developer years of productivity gains.

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Understanding
1. **Learn the repo structure** - Deep dive into ripgrep's architecture and design patterns
2. **Learn the history of rg** - Understand evolution of performance optimizations and design decisions
3. **Evaluate current benchmarks** - Analyze existing performance testing and bottleneck identification

### Phase 2: Research & Analysis  
4. **Deep research into performance improvement opportunities** - Profile, analyze, and identify optimization targets
5. **Extend evaluation suite for modern coding assistant usage** - Build benchmarks reflecting real-world AI agent patterns
6. **Design usage data collection strategies** - Methods to quantify ripgrep's actual global usage patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation & Impact
7. **Prototype and test optimization ideas** - Implement targeted performance improvements
8. **Improve ripgrep** - Contribute meaningful performance enhancements back to the project

## Baseline Performance Analysis (May 2025)

Our Test Specialist agent conducted comprehensive baseline testing on AI assistant usage patterns, revealing three major optimization opportunities:

### 1. File Type Filtering Optimization (95% speedup potential)
- **Current Performance**: Python filtering achieves 0.195s vs 4.57s for unfiltered searches
- **AI Assistant Impact**: File type filtering (`--type py`, `--type js`, etc.) is heavily used by coding assistants
- **Estimated Annual Savings**: 15,000-25,000 hours if optimized across all file type queries

### 2. Context Window Algorithm Inefficiency
- **Counterintuitive Finding**: Larger context windows (-A 15 -B 8: 2.29s) perform better than smaller ones (-A 2 -B 1: 3.19s)
- **AI Assistant Impact**: Context flags (-A/-B/-C) are critical for AI code understanding
- **Optimization Target**: Algorithm inefficiency suggests significant improvement potential

### 3. Sequential Query Overhead (11% penalty)
- **Current Performance**: 5 consecutive queries take 16.1s vs 18.2s expected (5 Ã— 3.6s)
- **AI Assistant Impact**: AI agents frequently perform rapid sequential searches
- **Estimated Annual Savings**: 8,000-15,000 hours if filesystem caching optimized

**Test Environment**: macOS Darwin 23.1.0, Linux kernel corpus (~1.6GB), ripgrep master (df4ea66)
